											<h1>Hey, welcome to my data science project portfolio.</h1>
										</header>
										<p>In this page I show my skills to handle business problems in both public and private area using data science tools and concepts. Some of these projects are real case situations about the brazilian tax system area which I deal with as an government tax auditor. Also there are projects using public data. </p>
										<p>You are going to find my professional experience and my skills in data science tools.</p>

										<h1>About me </h1>

										<h2 id="content">My name is Danillo Barros</h2>
										<p>I have major in statistics. I studied in a public college in Brazil and 
											at San Diego State University (US) as an exchange student. Currently, 
											I am tax inspector of the State of Alagoas in Brazil working as a
											data scientist and data analyst. It is an achievement for me finding solutions
											for business problems using data products such as insights, dashboards,
											predictive models and business reports.</p>
										<p>I work monitoring big companies that have tax breaks, verifying if they are
											satisfying their tax obligations in order to get these benefits, besides of detecting
											and building frauds signs in tax payments for all types of companies and situations. 
											Likewise, I calculate constants that are used in determining tax of some products such as 
											alcohol, wheat, gas using statistical methodologies. I also work in personal data science 
											projects.</p>

									<!-- ExperiÃªncia -->
										<h2 id="content">2+ Data scientist and data analyst</h2>
										<p>Using statistics to create methodologies which determines the consumer selling 
											price of a product to define its tax basis. Creating reports and dashboards to 
											monitoring companies tax obligations and calculating how much they must pay in 
											taxes.<br><br>
											Main results: <br>
											1) Create a metodology that almost double the tax basis of ethanol which increase
											tax collection of this product in at least 30%.<br><br>
											2) Create a metodology that define a fair tax basis for gasoline, diesel oil, 
											kerosene and ethanol based on consumer selling price of gas stations. <br> <br>
											3) Creating an Python program which calculate aggregate margin that were outdated
											 of lots of products to increase their tax basis. These new margins increase tax
											 collection in more than R$ 40 milions. <br> <br>
											4) Creating a report and dashboard in python to calculate how much some specific companies
											must pay in taxes. These report resulted in more than R$ 30 milion in notifications.

										</p> 
										<h2 id="content">2+ Data science projects</h2>
										<p>Building data solutions for business problems, close to real challenges 
											faced by companies, using publicly available data from Data Science competitions, 
											where I tackled the problem from the conception of the business challenge to the 
											deployment of the trained algorithm in production, using Cloud Computing tools.</p>
										<h2 id="content">2+ Tax inspector</h2>
										<p>I currently work monitoring operational movements of big companies that have 
											tax breaks, veryfing if they are satisfying their tax obligations in order 
											to get these benefits. In case of those conditions are not satisfied, 
											I calculate how much companies own and send notifications charging these values. </p>
										<h2 id="content">Business Analysis Manager (Dec 2020 - May 2021)</h2>
										<p>I lead a business intelligence team that work creating and managing data of Alagoas
											 Treasury Department in order to spot tax irregularities and frauds.<br>
											 <br>
										Main results:<br>
										1) Lead the team to develop a dashboard to detect which companies paid less than what was declared in tax returns. This dashboard result in more than R$ 10 milions in tax notifications.</p>

											<h3>High Customers Identification</h3>
											<p>This is an end-to-end data science project which a clusterization algorithm 
												was used to select most valuable customers in order to create a loyalty 
												program called insiders. Also, a dashboard in Metabase was created to 
												monitoring these customers and their metrics. This dashboard is hosted
												in a EC2 service provided by AWS.</p>

											<h3>Insurance Cross-sell</h3>
											<p>This is an end-to-end data science project which a classification algorithm
												was used to rank clients which would be interested in getting a car insurance. 
												It was used machine learning Random Forest algorithm to sort these clients.
												The deployment was did in a AWS cloud server (EC2) and results was accessed
												through Google sheets.</p>

											<h3>Rossmann sales Prediction</h3>
											<p>This is an end-to-end data science project which predict sales of the next six
												weeks of Rossmann stores. It was used machine learning XGBoost algorithm to 
												predict these sales. APIs and model was hosted in a EC2 server of AWS cloud. 
												Predictions of each store can be accessed by users through Telegram as shown

											<p>This is an A/B testing project that was made to see if a new version of a sign up 
												button in a website is better than current one. This A/B testing was made using a
												reinforcement learning algorithm called Multi-Bandit Armed (MAB) with a bayesian
												agent (Thompson Sampling).</p>
